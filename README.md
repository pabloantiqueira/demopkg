# demopkg

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ‘demopkg’ is to provide some demonstrations of R functions
and so vignettes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ‘demopkg’ from
[GitHub](https://github.com/pabloantiqueira/demopkg) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/pabloantiqueira/demopkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(demopkg)

M <- make_data()
```

Use this code like this…

``` r
plot(rnorm(100))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cars-1.png" width="100%" />

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
